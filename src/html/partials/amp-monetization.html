                    Accelerated Mobile Pages is an open-source web framework and
                    publishing platform developed by Google in 2015. It helps you to build a simplified version of your
                    web pages, providing super quick loading times and increased user experience as a result. At its
                    heart, AMP stands for a stripped-down version of HTML built to be incredibly lightweight and simple
                    to use.
                </p>
                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">
                    Simply put, this implies that advertisers can run ads that load
                    quicker and boost engagement by providing improved user functionality while maintaining key
                    monetization capabilities.

                <h2 class="line-height-4 heads dark-gray">Advantages of using AMP</h2>
                <h4 class="line-height-4 heads dark-gray">User Experience</h4>
                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">
                    Speed means better loading times and as a result better user
                    experience. It impacts how long visitors spend on your site meaning the more time they spend
                    engaging with your content. This is a key factor for long term success of your site and increased ad
                    revenue from your properties.
                </p>

                <h4 class="line-height-4 heads dark-gray">Ease of use</h4>
                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">
                    With mobile usage on the rise and outstripping users on desktops means we have to do more with
                    limitations of bandwidth. This is where AMP really shines but also how easy it is to implement.
                </p>

                <h4 class="line-height-4 heads dark-gray">Open source</h4>
                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">
                    Being open source means there is a wealth of resources available between publishers, developers and
                    tech companies. There is a whole community that supports the advancement of AMP that includes
                    publishers, platforms, advertisers, creators and users alike.

                <h4 class="line-height-4 heads dark-gray">SEO benefits</h4>
                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">
                    It’s common knowledge that faster loading pages is a factor that Google considers when it looks to
                    rank your pages in it’s search results. Also it’s worth noting that since AMP is a Google product
                    there will naturally be a bias towards its value in comparison to other non amp sites which could
                    lead to better rankings.
