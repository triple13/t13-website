                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">
                    Floors is a constantly learning piece of technology that optimises Unified Pricing Rules in Google
                    AdManager to create increased revenues.
                </p>
                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">
                    The algorithm primary focus is to create the highest amount of revenue for each ad-request sent to
                    Google AdManager. Please note that its focus is on Ad-Request eCPM and this will create some level
                    of unfilled impressions.
                </p>
                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">
                    These unfilled impressions need to happen, as they are the bi-product of setting the optimal floor
                    pricing and getting the best overall returns. Yes, you can fill these unfilled impressions with a
                    house campaign if you so wish.
                </p>
                <h3 class="line-height-4 heads dark-gray">What results should be expected?</h3>
                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">
                    Most publishers see between a 30 to 50% revenue increase over an extended period of time. When
                    Floors is first put to work on new inventory this percentage will likely be higher for a period of
                    time, until the dynamic buyers DSP/buying platform technologies get accustomed to the new norm of
                    the inventory pricing.
                </p>
                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">
                    There are no underhand bidding practices happening inside of Floors, the magic is managing & testing
                    millions of pricing combinations at scale. Floors optimises across website, ad-unit, ad-size, geo,
                    device, day and hour to ensure the right pricing is applied.
