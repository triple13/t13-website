                    Since Amazon entered the advertising market,
                    there has been a shift in how things are done.
                    This is because they are leveraging on
                    first-party consumer data, an established
                    DSP business, and a header bidding solution.
                    All these solutions are built under the
                    "Amazon Publisher Services”  (AMP), which is
                    a suite of cloud-based solutions.

                    interest in ads and get highly niche targeted

                    will benefit from Amazon by advertising to a
                    larger range of audiences beyond the normal.
