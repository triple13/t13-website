                    Floors is a constantly learning piece of technology that optimises Unified Pricing Rules in
                    Google
                    AdManager to create increased revenues.

                    The algorithm primary focus is to create the highest amount of revenue for each ad-request sent
                    to
                    Google AdManager. Please note that its focus is on Ad-Request eCPM and this will create some
                    level

                    setting the optimal floor pricing and getting the best overall returns. Yes, you can fill these
                    unfilled impressions with a house campaign if you so wish.

                    What results should be expected?
                </h3>
                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">

                    Most publishers see between a 30 to 50% revenue increase over an extended period of time. When
                    Floors is first put to work on new inventory this percentage will likely be higher for a period
                    of
                    time, until the dynamic buyers DSP/buying platform technologies get accustomed to the new norm
                    of
                    the inventory pricing. There are no underhand bidding practices happening inside of Floors, the
                    magic is managing & testing millions of pricing combinations at scale. Floors optimises across
                    website, ad-unit, ad-size, geo, device, day and hour to ensure the right pricing is applied.
                </p>
                <h3 class="line-height-4 heads dark-gray">
                    Are there any exceptions on the expected results?
                </h3>
                <p class="line-height-3 desc light-gray">
                    Yes, there are a few small fringe instances where Floors hasn't seen seen the usual large
                    revenue
                    uplifts. Floors works extremely well with demand which has some level of dynamic or varied
                    pricing
                    and good examples of this are header bidding and Google AdExchange. The reason Floors works so
                    well
                    here is because its constantly optimising an unknown optimal floor price for each ad-request and
                    thats where the magic happens. So why do some cases not work as expected? The answer is fairly
                    straight forward, if the publisher/inventory to be optimised is heavily (85%+) sold out with
                    direct
                    campaigns then the uplift is likely to be stunted. That doesn't mean you won't see great
                    results,
                    but most of the magic happens away from the direct campaigns.
