                    Instead of creating an individual account for
                    each user, team accounts allow multiple users
                    to work within the same Google Ad Manager 360
                    account. Teams are assigned different permissions
                    and can choose what advertisers and sites
                    they want to deal with.

                    structured and easier to analyze and produce
                    reports for each different line of business.

                    These are some additional benefits of using Google
                    Ad Manager 360. It comes with full-on requirements
                    for manpower and understanding the platform in-depth,
                    so it can be challenging for publishers to get
                    started on GAM360.

                    Switching from Ad Manager to GAM 360 is a big decision.
                    On the plus side, it includes powerful features and
                    benefits that will make your life easier. But on the
                    downside, it takes time and money to set up. A Google
                    Certified Publishing Partner like Triple13 can get
                    the most out of your Ad Manager 360 account and help
