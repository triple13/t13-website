                    These are some additional benefits of using Google
                    Ad Manager 360. It comes with full-on requirements
                    for manpower and understanding the platform in-depth,
                    so it can be challenging for publishers to get
                    started on GAM360.

                    Switching from Ad Manager to GAM 360 is a big decision.
                    On the plus side, it includes powerful features and
                    benefits that will make your life easier. But on the
                    downside, it takes time and money to set up. A Google
                    Certified Publishing Partner like Triple13 can get
                    the most out of your Ad Manager 360 account and help
                    solve any problems you may have.
