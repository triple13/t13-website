                    There has been a massive growth in the ad tech
                    ecosystem and the programmatic advertising sector,
                    thanks to the exponential growth and innovations
                    initiated by major players in the industry. These
                    innovations have given publishers the capability
                    to connect with hundreds and thousands of media
                    buyers across the globe.

                    One of such innovations is Google Adsense, but it
                    is not the only one but arguably one of the best
                    in the ad network sector for publishers when it
                    comes to monetizing their inventories.

                    Simply put, an Ad exchange is a programmatic
                    marketplace that is a bridge or a link
                    between publishers and advertisers. It facilitates
                    them to trade media via middlemen like Demand-side
                    platforms and supply-side platforms in real-time.

                        How Google Adx and Adsense came about
                    </h3>
                </div>
                <div class="rox2 rcx8 rol2 rcl8">
                    It all started with a company, DoubleClick
                    in 1996 as an independent brand that offered
                    ad services. In 2008, it was acquired by Google
                    for $3.1 billion. This was the birth of Google
                    Ad Exchange whose sole purpose was to bring publishers,
                    advertisers, and agencies together so that
                    everyone can get a cut out of the ad industry.
                </div>

                <br>

                <div class="rox2 rcx8 rol2 rcl8">
                    On the other hand, Adsense was released in June
                    of 2003. It grew to become a popular word amongst
                    publishers. This can be attributed to the fact
                    that it is a free service available to publishers
                    to display ads on their websites. Furthermore,
                    Adsense is comparatively easy to use for smaller
                    publishers and medium-sized publishers.
                </div>

                <div class="rox2 rcx8 rol2 rcl8">
                    So what exactly are Adx and Adsense? What makes
                    them different from each other?

                        What exactly are Adsense and Adx?
                    </h3>
                </div>
                <div class="rox2 rcx8 rol2 rcl8">
                    In simple terms, Adsense can be seen as a self-managed
                    platform for running ads. Once you (publisher)
                    are approved by Adsense, you are given a tag to
                    place on your website. Once this is done, it starts
                    working. However, Adsense tends to benefit advertisers
                    more than the publishers. This might be
                    because Adsense ads are rendered from Google Ads
                    and Adwords, which are designed for low-cost
                    impressions. Also, Adsense does not allow publishers
                    to set a floor price, which implies that they can't
                    utilize the inventory.

                <div class="rox2 rcx8 rol2 rcl8">
                    On the other hand, Google Adx or Google Ad Exchange
                    is an ad Exchange network (remember what we
                    said about an Ad exchange at the beginning?)
                </div>

                <br>

                <div class="rox2 rcx8 rol2 rcl8">
                    Adx simply brings publishers, advertisers, and
                    agencies together with the primary purpose of
                    providing real-time biddings, auctions, and deals.
                    This brings about healthy competition for the
                    inventory and, in turn, makes good money for the publishers.

                    Google Adsense is free, and you don't need to worry
                    about its management. Google Adsense manages everything
                    for you, from the placement of ads to payments.

                    The question of which is better can only be
                    answered by you depending on your business
                    budget and expertise. Eventually, Adsense
                    offers room for low budget advertisers and
                    an opportunity for all websites to make a
                    profit from placing ads on their website.
                    This can be done with little or no experience
                    and can be automated.

                    On the other hand, Adx is more costly and
                    quite complicated and usually requires expert
                    management to make the most out of it. The
                    advantage it has over Adsense is that it
                    has a larger inventory with more control.
