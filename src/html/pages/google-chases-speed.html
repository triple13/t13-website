                    Google is changing the way they rank sites and there is a simple equation to follow,

                    The main reasons why websites are inherently slow and provide poor experience on mobile
                    is because they are overloaded with heavy code & scripts that slows them down in the process.
                    Improving your site speed has a direct impact on if your visitors stay or leave your page.
                    That decision on mobile takes less than 3 seconds.

                    Google has had the solution for publishers for a while now and you have probably already heard of it.
                    Accelerated Mobile Pages or AMP for short. It works by loading incredibly fast
                    stripped down versions of full web pages for mobile viewing.

                    This ultimately means you get more traffic because your site has higher perceived

                    This is where AMP comes into the picture, Jarrod Dicker, said AMP improves click-through
                    rates by up to 50 percent. He also said, “The Post publishes over 1,000 articles in AMP every day,
                    and they're already seeing concrete benefits…  We have seen load times average 400 milliseconds,
                    an 88% improvement over our traditional mobile website.

                        <li>AMP eliminates all non-essential elements for better functionality and speed that allows pages to be pre-rendered and load web pages instantly.</li>
